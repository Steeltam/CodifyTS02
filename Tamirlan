"A lonely shape at my door, as death walked in
Turned his grey face toward me
No eyes, but his stare pierced my soul
No words, but I knew his reasons well"

"Nothing here for me, just a burden to others
I followed his slow steps
Quiet sighs straight into the night"

Through these streets of flashing lights
Shapes with eyes like shadows and stares so hollow
Nowhere to go, but lower from here
Deeper, down into the fear and hopelessness

Hell everywhere around me
So why would I have anything to lose if I follow
Through this city of long shadows we walked
This world of empty souls

"Kingdom of fear and hearts so lost, abandoned by the light
Cells of empty shells, filling their insides
With promises of something, anything"

These grey towers around me, climbing toward the night sky
Reaching for the clouds, like birds so black high above
With their all seeing eyes, the halo of their stares
